# CodeAlpha Task : Rule-Based Chatbot (Python)

1] Task Objective:

The goal of this task is to build a simple rule-based chatbot using Python that can interact with users based on predefined rules and responses.

2]Task Description:

This chatbot takes basic user inputs such as greetings or common questions and replies with predefined answers. It continues to interact with the user until the user decides to exit the conversation.

3] Scope of the Project:

Accepts user inputs like:

4]Provides predefined responses:

Hi!
I'm fine, thanks!
Goodbye!
what can you do 
tell me jokes
Runs continuously until the user types bye


5] Key Concepts Used:

if-elif-else conditions
Functions
Loops (while)
Input and Output operations
String handling




6] How to Run the Program:

1. Install Python 3.x on your system.
2. Copy the code into a file named chatbot.py.
3. Open terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the file using:
   python chatbot.py



7] Sample Output:

                Chatbot: Hello! Type 'bye' to exit.
                You: hello
                Chatbot: Hi!
                You: how are you

                You: bye
                Chatbot: Goodbye!



8] Conclusion:

   This project demonstrates a basic understanding of Python programming concepts such as conditional statements, functions, loops, and user interaction. It serves as a         foundation for building more advanced chatbots in the future.
